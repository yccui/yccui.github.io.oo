I'm a Ph.D. candidate at Northwestern University, advised by [Matthew Kay](https://www.mjskay.com/). My research explores the intersection of algorithms, data science, and human-computer interaction. Currently, I'm interested in developing rigorous methods to assess people's visualization literacy and creating interventions to help people detect visualization misinformation.I'm passionate about understanding and guiding human behavior and system design to bring positive social impact to our world.

I co-organize the <a href="https://www.md4sg.com/">Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG)</a> research initiative with <a href="https://www.fmarmolejo.com/">Francisco J. Marmolejo Coss√≠o</a>, <a href="https://georgeobaido.com/">George Obaido</a>, <a href="https://www.matthewolckers.com/">Matthew Olckers</a>, <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~as5001/">Ana-Andreea Stoica</a>, and <a href="https://lily-x.github.io/">Lily Xu</a>.

I served as a [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in Summer 2022, where I worked with Vibrant Emotional Health to improve the service of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline through data-driven call routing.
